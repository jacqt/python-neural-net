This project is comprised of three parts

The first part is a simple python implementation of a feed forward 
neural network that is trained through backpropagation. 

The second part is a collection of scripts as well as the images in the 
data folder. The scripts preprocess the images and then uses the
neural network to build a digit recognition neural network.

The third part consists of two scripts; one script called ExtractCharacters.py,
takes an image and attempts to extract the individual characters from it, and 
then converts it into the feature vector. The other script takes the feature 
vector, feeds it to a supplied neural network and prints out its guess of the
numerical representation of the digits.
